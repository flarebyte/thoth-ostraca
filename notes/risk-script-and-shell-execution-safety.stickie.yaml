  Description:

  - Inline scripting and optional shell execution may enable command injection,
  unsafe environment access, or data exfiltration if misused.


  Mitigation:

  - Sandbox Lua (limited libs), default strict templating, prefer argv over
  shell parsing, disable os/io by default, validate inputs, and provide secure
  defaults.
labels:
  - design
