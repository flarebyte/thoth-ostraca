  Description:

  - Walking large trees, reading many files, and running transforms in parallel
  can exhaust CPU, memory, or I/O bandwidth, causing slowdowns or timeouts.


  Mitigation:

  - Bounded worker pool, configurable timeouts/limits, deterministic ordering
  for aggregated output, and streaming (--lines) for better throughput.
labels:
  - design
