background: |-
    Maintain a concise, up-to-date list of the features that should be supported by
    thoth-ostraca. This board exists to make capabilities discoverable for humans
    and easy to parse for AI agents when planning, troubleshooting, or proposing
    changes.
guidelines: |-
    One stickie per feature by default. Create additional stickies when distinct
    aspects of the same feature deserve separate notes (e.g., UXD, accessibility,
    performance, security, monitoring, operations, compliance, documentation,
    legal). Keep each note concise and focused on what is not obvious, with emphasis
    on the “why” (intent, trade-offs, constraints, and rationale). Prefer neutral,
    implementation-agnostic phrasing. Use labels from this controlled set when
    relevant: usecase, example, flow, design, implementation, decision, security, operations, 
    compliance, glossary, principle, validation, howto, faq, library, wip, stable. 
    Make each stickie independently useful: when helpful, include links or identifiers. 
    AI-friendly style: short sentences, explicit nouns, one idea per stickie.
