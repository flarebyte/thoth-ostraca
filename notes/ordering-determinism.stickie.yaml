    - Aggregated output (array): deterministic sort
    - Sort key: 'locator' for pipeline; 'file.relPath' for create/update/diff
    - Reduce: consumes values in the same deterministic order as the aggregated array
    - Streaming (--lines): order is nondeterministic due to parallelism; each line is independent JSON value
labels:
  - design
